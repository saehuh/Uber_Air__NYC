## Background

In 2019, Uber announced that Uber Air flying taxis will take off in Dallas, Los Angeles and Melbourne in 2023. Uber Air is a shared air transporation service between suburbs and cities to start, and ultimately within cities. The company believes Urban Air Mobility(UAM) presents an opportunity to decongest road traffic, improve mobility, give back time to those trapped in daily traffic, and unlock the potential of cities worldwide.

Uber Air's ecosystem consists of 4 fundamental systems, OEM partnerships for electric VTOLs(vertical take-off and landing vehicles), infrastructure partnerships for skyports, airspace management system and multimodal journey, that the Uber Elevate team and its partners are developing.

VTOLs are similar to helicopters and will carry four passengers at low altitude from skyports in each metro area and will seamlessly string a ground transportation segment to a skyport, with a pooled point-to-point flight, and a just-in-time ground transportation leg to a riderâ€™s final destination. The short flights will start at $5 per mile, so a 20-mile trip would add up to about $100 though Uber Elevate officials anticipate that the cost will go down eventually. 

Above mentioned cities have already put together elaborate plans and designs for their services and skyports, but what about New York?


### Market consideration for Uber Air

A typical Uber Air market will usually have the following characteristics.

#### Size (land area)

A large human settlement spread over a large area, e.g Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) Metroplex encompasses 4,848 square miles, and Los Angeles (LA) metro land area is spread over 8,928 square miles. New York City has an estimated 2019 population of 8,336,817 distributed over about 302.6 square miles (784 km2), which is not spread wide enough. However, the New York metropolitan area is the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban landmass, at 3,450.2 sq mi (8,936 km2).

#### Population and population density

The population is greater than 1 million and the population density is greater than 1,000 people per square mile. The New York metropolitan area is the most populous in the United States, as defined by both the Metropolitan Statistical Area (20.3 million residents in 2017) and the Combined Statistical Area (23.7 million residents in 2016).

#### Existing transportation network

An expansive ground transportation network that includes public transportation systems. A strong existing transportation network is essential, as riders will be provided the option of an existing form of ground transportation to and from skyports as part of the Uber Air journey. New York City's transportation system includes subway, bus, ferry, Taxi as well as FHV(For-hire Vehicles). 

#### At least one large airport

Airports typically aggregate transportation demand. Airports that are separated from the city center by a trip of an hour or more due to distance, traffic, or other bottlenecks, provide a compelling use case for a foundational route. New York has three robust airports in JFK, Newark and LaGuardia.

#### Traffic congestion

Increasing traffic congestion that results in high travel times and congestion costs. For example, in 2019, each vehicle commuter, in DFW Metroplex, spent 45 hours in traffic at an annual congestion cost of $1,160. Similarly, annual congestion cost in LA area is $2,440. The ideal city is polycentric, with multiple dense nodes of development separated by frequent congestion. According to INRIX 2019 Traffic Scorecard Report, New York City is 4th most congested city in the US and 14th in the world with 140 hours spent in congestions.

#### Stable environmental conditions

Adverse weather conditions can influence many components of Uber Air, including operational reliability, service supply, and rider comfort.
